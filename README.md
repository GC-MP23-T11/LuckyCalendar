## Description
Existing services such as _"Today's Fortune"_ only provide groundless fortunes based on the user's constellation or birthday. </br>
Away from this unilateral and unscientific fortune-telling, </br>
We thought about having an app that __actively records your daily fortune__. </br>
We created an app that allows you to __record your fortune__ for the day by entering a short diary along with your daily fortune.
And you can see this month's fortune at a glance through the _statistics page_. </br>
Using the statistics page, users can understand your fortune for this month and have time to think about how they will live in the future. </br>
